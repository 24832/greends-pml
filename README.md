- Extra material
  
  - **Session 'Introduction'**
    * Run [this notebook](test_GPU.ipynb) to compare CPU with CPU+GPU (try it in Colab: first, go to menu 'runtime/change runtime type' in Colab and choose GPU as hardware accelarator)
    
  - **Session 'Getting started'**
  
  - **Session 'Deployment'**
