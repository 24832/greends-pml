        "        Organize your data into two sets: one set of color images and one set of corresponding mask images with the labeled classes.\n",
        "        Ensure that the color images and mask images have the same dimensions and are properly aligned.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Split your data:\n",
        "        Split your data into a training set and a validation set. The training set will be used to train the classifier, and the validation set will be used to evaluate its performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Preprocess your data:\n",
        "        Depending on the requirements of your classifier, you may need to preprocess your color images, such as resizing, normalization, or data augmentation techniques. Apply the same preprocessing steps consistently to both the color images and mask images.\n",

        "    Train a classifier:\n",
        "        Choose a suitable classifier for image segmentation, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) commonly used in computer vision tasks.\n",
        "        Use the training set to train the classifier. Provide the color images as input and the corresponding mask images as target labels.\n",
        "        During training, optimize the classifier's parameters to minimize the difference between predicted segmentations and the ground truth masks.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Validate and fine-tune the classifier:\n",
        "        Use the validation set to assess the performance of your trained classifier. Evaluate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or Intersection over Union (IoU) to measure segmentation quality.\n",
        "                If necessary, fine-tune the classifier by adjusting hyperparameters, changing the architecture, or applying regularization techniques to improve its performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Apply the classifier for segmentation:\n",
        "        Once you have a trained and validated classifier, you can use it to segment new images.\n",
        "        Preprocess the new color images using the same steps applied to the training set.\n",
        "        Pass the preprocessed images through the trained classifier to obtain the segmentation results.\n",
        "        Post-process the segmentation results if needed, such as applying thresholds or smoothing operations, to refine the output.\n",

Consult the documentation and examples of the relevant libraries to guide you through the process."
